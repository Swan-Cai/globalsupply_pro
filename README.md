Background of Project
I have some friends who run factories in China and provide some raw materials and components to manufacturers in countries around the world who need them. They can provide high-quality products at competitive prices. However, due to the difficulty of language communication, geographical distance and cultural differences, it is difficult for them to find their target customers. At the same time, due to the shortage of raw materials and parts, some foreign manufacturers have affected their production and business.
In today's digital landscape, having a comprehensive online presence is crucial for business success. By developing an independent e-commerce website with an admin panel and CRM functionality, we aim to provide the company with a powerful tool to showcase products/services, manage website content, and streamline customer relationship management.
